<h1>Extrusion Gear Pumps Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Extrusion Gear Pumps is a component of the extrusion equipment. The main function of the Extrusion Gear Pumps is to keep the flow and pressure of the melt flow to the die at a continuous and constant level, which means to precisely control output to the die. Extrusion Gear Pumpss consist of two gears, usually driven by a single motor. The extruder fills the gears from the suction side, and the rotating gears discharge the polymer on the other side. By precisely controlling the output of melt it eliminates many of the variables that impact extruder throughput stability.</p>
