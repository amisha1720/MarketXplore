<h1>Tabletop (Desktop & Benchtop) SEM Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>A scanning electron <strong>microscope</strong> (SEM) is a type of electron <strong>microscope</strong> that produces images of a sample by scanning the surface with a focused beam of electrons. The electrons interact with atoms in the sample, producing various signals that contain information about the surface topography and composition of the sample. The electron beam is scanned in a raster scan pattern, and the position of the beam is combined with the intensity of the detected signal to produce an image. In the most common SEM mode, secondary electrons emitted by atoms excited by the electron beam are detected using a secondary electron detector (Everhart-Thornley detector). The number of secondary electrons that can be detected, and thus the signal intensity, depends, among other things, on specimen topography. SEM can achieve resolution better than 1 nanometer.</p>
