<h1>Klystrons Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>A klystron is a specialized linear-beam vacuum tube. In a klystron, an electron beam interacts with radio waves as it passes through resonant cavities, metal boxes along the length of a tube. The electron beam first passes through a cavity to which the input signal is applied. The energy of the electron beam amplifies the signal, and the amplified signal is taken from a cavity at the other end of the tube. The output signal can be coupled back into the input cavity to make an electronic oscillator to generate radio waves.</p>
