<h1>Rail Welding Machines Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Rail welding machines are used for applications involving new rail installation as well as maintenance welding for existing track. Continuous welded rail (CWR) creates a smooth, continuous length of rail necessary for an efficiently functioning railroad. There are different methods of welding, but the most common is electric flash welding and thermite welding. Flash butt welding is the most reliable joining technology for track construction and it is a proven fact that it provides the lowest failure frequency.</p>
