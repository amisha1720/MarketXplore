<h1>Mass Flow Controller Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>The principle of the mass flow controller is to detect and control the gas mass flow by forming the temperature difference between the upstream and downstream of the baseline in the case of overcurrent. The mass flow controller can precisely control the gas mass flow. Its function is to precisely control the flow rate of the carrier gas and reaction gas entering the cavity per unit time to achieve the required mixing ratio for the reaction.</p>
