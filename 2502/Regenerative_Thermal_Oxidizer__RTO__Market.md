<h1>Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer (RTO) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer (RTO) is an incinerator. Its principle is to oxidize combustible exhaust gas into corresponding oxides and water at high temperature to purify the exhaust gas and recover the heat released when the exhaust gas decomposes. The exhaust gas decomposition efficiency is over 99%, and the heat recovery efficiency is over 95%. The main structure of the RTO consists of a combustion chamber, a ceramic packing bed and a switching valve.</p>
