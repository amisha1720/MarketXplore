<h1>Digital PCR (dPCR) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Digital PCR (Digital PCR-dPCR) technology is a new method for nucleic acid detection and quantification. Unlike traditional quantitative PCR (qPCR) technology, digital PCR uses absolute quantification and does not rely on standard curves and reference samples to directly detect targets The copy number of the sequence. Because this detection method has better sensitivity, specificity and accuracy than traditional qPCR, dPCR has been widely used quickly. This technology is used in the detection of very small amounts of nucleic acid samples, detection of rare mutations in complex backgrounds and identification of small differences in expression levels. The realized advantages have been widely recognized, and its many advantages in gene expression research, microRNA research, genome copy number identification, rare mutation detection of cancer markers, identification of pathogenic microorganisms, identification of transgenic components, accurate quantification of NGS sequencing libraries, and result verification, etc. The broad application prospects it has already received more and more attention.</p>
