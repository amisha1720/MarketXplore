<h1>Biogas Generator Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Biogas is a renewable gas that is produced by anaerobic microorganisms. These microbes feed off carbohydrates and fats, producing methane and carbon dioxides as metabolic waste products. This gas can be harnessed by man as a source of sustainable energy.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>A biogas generator is made up of three main components; the biogas engine or power plant, the generator that is coupled with the engine and controller. The controller is a small component that makes the world of difference to the overall system performance.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The biogas is supplied to the gas generator set by the gas storage tank through the desulfurizer, thereby driving the generator connected to the biogas internal combustion engine to generate electric power.</p>
