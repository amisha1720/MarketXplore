<h1>LCoS Spatial Light Modulators (LCOS-SLM) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) technology has been developed for many years for image and video display applications. This technology combines the unique light-modulating properties of liquid crystal (LC) materials and the advantages of high-performance silicon complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology through dedicated LCOS assembly processes. Unlike the conventional LC flat panel displays, an LCOS device can be either transmissive or reflective and can be used to alter the polarization or the phase of an incident light beam utilizing the electrically modulated optical properties of LCs. Such devices are usually called LCOS spatial light modulators (SLMs).</p>
